# Calculator

This application was created as an assessment to GasPedaal. It is a calculator where the user has to be able to do the following:

- addition

- subtraction

- multiplication

- division

- exponents

- roots

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

## Points of improvments

For future implements I could improve the UI to give a better experience in the exponential method to the user be able to set the base and differents exponentials, now they only can use the exponential 2.
